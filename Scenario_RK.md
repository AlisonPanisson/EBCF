## Experimental Evaluation 

In this section, we show our results for the Enthymeme-based Communication Framework based on the scenario published in [2,3,4,5], 
describing the use of argumentation scheme from role to know. 

### Scenario - Role to Know

This dialogue is showed in the following output from Jason Platform:
_________________________
![Scenario Roel to Know](img/cod2_enthy0202_v1.png)
_________________________
The corresponding dialogue using Enthymemes for this dialogue, based on the implementation described in the paper, is showed below:

_________________________

Note that, for this experiment, agents reduce the length of messages, when communicating enthymeme, in an average of 48% 
(45% the first argument, and 51% the second argument). Note that two premises of these arguments are organisational knowledge.
